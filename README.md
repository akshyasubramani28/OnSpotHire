# OnSpotHire
A Smart Job Posting & Hiring Web App (Demo Version, Work-in-Progress)

OnSpotHire is a Java-based web application that helps small and medium businesses post jobs and manage candidate applications easily. The app uses Java Servlets for the backend, Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern interface, and runs on Apache Tomcat.

## How to Run the Demo

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OnSpotHire.git
Navigate into the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd OnSpotHire
Build the project using Maven:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean package
This will create a WAR file in the target/ folder.

Deploy the WAR file to your local Tomcat server by copying the WAR file into the webapps folder.

Start Tomcat (if itâ€™s not already running):

bash
Copy code
cd C:\path\to\tomcat\bin
.\startup.bat
Open the app in your browser:

http://localhost:8080/OnSpotHire

You should see the Home page and basic functionality (job listing, apply page, etc.).

Demo Video / GIF
Add a short screen recording or GIF here to showcase the app in action. This helps HR visualize your project even if it's incomplete.

Example Markdown for GIF:

Notes
This repository demonstrates a working demo version of the app. While not all features are complete, it shows the core flow of posting, browsing, and applying for jobs.

If you paste **exactly this into your README.md**, it will show:  

- **Grey blocks** for commands/code HR might want to copy.  
- **White/black text** for descriptions and instructions.  

I can also **add badges at the top** (Java, Maven, Tomcat, WIP) to make it look extra professional.  

Do you want me to add badges too?
